Principles:

Most people need to know just a few important things about their finances:

How much money do I have?
Am I spending less than I’m earning?
How much did I spend last month?
What am I spending my money on?
This app answers all of those questions and gives the user a simple interface to categorize, organize, and get to those answers quicker. While some users might look for a richer feature set, we believe most users are satisfied with less; not more.
